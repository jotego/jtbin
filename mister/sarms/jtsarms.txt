JTSArms FPGA clone of Side Arms arcade faithful to original hardware
======================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $250 PCB according to eBay. You have in your hands
a faithful conversion of the circuits on the Tiger Road PCB to FPGA. If you come from
the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-Palettes determined by the original PROMs
-Graphics priority handled by the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-Sound sampling rate: 41.663 kHz (original, 125/3 kHz)
-Accurate FPS 100% same as real hardware (61Hz)

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

For Side Arms there are some additional differences with MAME:

-CPU speed 8MHz vs 4MHz
-Star Field
-Palette circuit with error bit

GAME PLAY
=========

The game uses two buttons: shot and jump.

Note that by default the continue prompt is disabled. If you want to
be able to continue, change this in the OSD. You can then save your settings
so it will be the same the next time you powerup.

TEST SCREEN
===========
Select the test screen through the OSD menu. To pass on to the next test
screen press both action buttons.


REVISION HISTORY
================
14th August, 2020: Beta release
