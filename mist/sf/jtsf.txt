JTSF FPGA clone of Street Fighter arcade faithful to original hardware
======================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $250 PCB, at least I paid that for it. You have in your hands
a faithful conversion of the circuits on the Street Fighter 1 PCB to FPGA. If you come from
the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-Palettes determined by the original PROMs
-Graphics priority handled by the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-Sound sampling rate: 41.663 kHz (original, 125/3 kHz)
-Accurate FPS 100% same as real hardware (61Hz)

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

HARDWARE DIFFERENCES
====================

The registered PAL device is not being used. The DTACK timing may be wrong.
There might some additional video signals -like a palette error bit. I have not
looked for them on the PCB.


Issues
======

-ADPCM is a bit noisy, probably because of missing ROM reads


TEST SCREEN
===========
Select the test screen through the OSD menu. To pass on to the next test
screen press both action buttons.
