JTVulgus FPGA clone of GunSmoke arcade faithful to original hardware
=====================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $200 PCB as that is what I paid for the
board! You have in your hands a faithful conversion of the circuits on
the Vulgus PCB to FPGA. If you come from the emulation world here are 
some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with the same scan pattern as in the original hardware
-Palettes determined by the original PROMs
-Graphics priority handled by the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-3 button input
-Sound sampling rate exactly as the original
-Accurate FPS 100% same as real hardware

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

GAME PLAY
=========

The game uses two buttons: fire and missile. There is no continue screen.
If you see the POW or letter icons move while there is horizontal scrolling
going on and you think it is a bug, well, it isn't. That's just how the
hardware worked. Using a different scan sequence might avoid it. But I'm
using the original and it comes with that side effect (verified on the real PCB).
