JTBTiger FPGA clone of Black Tiger arcade faithful to original hardware
========================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive €315 PCB according to eBay. You have in your hands
a faithful conversion of the circuits on the Tiger Road PCB to FPGA. If you come from
the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with accurate delays
-Real CPU/MCU bus sharing with accurate delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-Exact timing for bus sharing with microcontroller
-Graphics priority handled as the original PROMs indicate
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-Sound sampling rate: exactly the original
-Accurate FPS 100% same as real hardware

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

MiST VERSION
============

The MiST version does not have sound because of lack of enough internal memory
in the FPGA. Maybe it can be fixed with some architectural change but I will
probably not do it myself unless several patrons ask for it.

MiSTer will feature sound in the release version, although the first beta doesn't
play sounds (the hardware is there but something fails in the CPU/MCU/2nd CPU interface)

GAME PLAY
=========

The game uses two buttons: shot and jump.

Note that by default the continue prompt is disabled. If you want to
be able to continue, change this in the OSD. You can then save your settings
so it will be the same the next time you powerup.

TEST SCREEN
===========
Select the test screen through the OSD menu. Press 1P coin button during ROM
test to access all test sections. To pass on to the next test screen press 
both action buttons.


REVISION HISTORY
================

 8 Mar 2020 Improved stability by eliminating the clock enable of the MCU 
            and using a 6MHz clock directly
 6 Jan 2020 Public release
24 Nov 2019 Beta release
