Pirate Ship Higemaru port for FPGA by Jose Tejada (jotego)
==========================================================

You have just got a very expensive arcade PCB, well $1.250 if the eBay seller would have it its way.
This is a very addictive game and one of the earliest CAPCOM arcades. Be sure to enjoy this piece of history!


CONVERSION DETAILS
==================

The conversion was done based on 1942 schematics and MAME driver for Higemaru. Based on the available
documentation, the implementation I have made is very likely to be highly accurate but I cannot confirm
it because I do not have access to the PCB nor the schematics -assuming schematics still exist for this game.

Interrupts are generated directly from the PROM and they do not occur at the same time as in MAME.
The connection for the interrupt PROM is based on 1942. Palette PROMs are also used where needed. I didn't
check the timing PROM and just assumed it was the same as all the other 8-bit CAPCOM games, which is very
likely to be the case.

TEST SCREEN
===========
Press the action button while powering up to enter the test screen. Some text in the test screens is not
displayed correctly. I think there is one input signal which is not being provided correctly. This doesn't
seem to be a problem during gameplay.
