JTCommando FPGA clone of Commando arcade faithful to original hardware
======================================================================

Please, read the main README file too.

You have just got an expensive $200 PCB according to eBay. You have in your hands
a faithful conversion of the circuits on the Commando PCB to FPGA. If you come from
the emulation world here are some of the things different from emulators:

-Real CPU/GPU bus sharing with delays
-Sprites handled with DMA exactly as in the original hardware
-Palettes determined by the original PROMs
-Graphics priority handled according to the original PROM
-No lag between image and input. Data is being sent to the screen in real time.
-No lag between sound and image. All hardware runs in parallel with no time multiplexing.
-Sound sampling rate: 41.663 kHz (i.e. exactly the original, 125/3 kHz)

These technical aspects mean that the game play will be different from an emulator
in a number of ways and that some hardware tricks that were not emulated will work
here as in the original hardware.

The ROM Master
==============
The ROM Master, aka Bruno Silva, has provided us with a .bat file to generate the necessary ROM file using MAME ROM files. Please follow the instructions of the .bat file to generate the ROM. The game works will all known ROMs.
